# This file is intended to be included directly (as in, copied) or 
# indirectly (as in using the source or "." command) into the likes of 
# .bash_login or similar location (i.e.  so it can be invoked anytime you 
# login or create a new window under the like of Konsole, Terminal, or such.  

# Once you do so, the value of $PS1 will be changed such that you will now 
# see the name of the currently set git branch (if in a git repos); this 
# will save always having to do a "git brach" to see where you are.  

# The contents of the gitbashps1 file is fairly common knowledge, so I take 
# no credit (nor responsibility) for its contents are actions (or lack 
# thereof) since it represents knowledge fairly common on "the net".  

# I just put it at github hoping it would be useful and so that I don't have 
# to remember how to do it the next time I tell a colleague about it: I just 
# have to point them at this repos.

# Place in one of the following bash files configuration (~/.bash_login, 
# ~/.bashrc, or ~/.bash_profile) as you choose (this depends on how you 
# normally use bash as well).  While I haven't tested this, I believe that 
# it should work with zsh or other bash-clone shells.  

# Output once in place will be similar to the following; change the bash 
# flags within .gitbashps1 as needed: 

# Here are the function statements you need to add:
